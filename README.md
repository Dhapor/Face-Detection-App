# Face, Palm & Gesture Recognition ðŸ¤–

This project utilizes **OpenCV**, **MediaPipe**, and **Streamlit** to build a real-time **Face**, **Palm**, and **Gesture Recognition** system. It can detect faces, hand gestures, and display the results via a live video stream.

## Features

- **Face Detection**: Detects faces using Haar Cascades (Viola-Jones).
- **Hand Gesture Detection**: Uses MediaPipe Hands to recognize hand gestures in real-time.
- **Real-time Video Stream**: The app uses your webcam to detect faces and hand gestures.
- **Custom Finger Gestures**: Includes common hand gestures like peace signs, thumbs up, and others.
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Powered by Streamlit for easy access and interaction.

## Technologies Used

- **OpenCV**: For face detection and image processing.
- **MediaPipe**: For real-time hand gesture recognition.
- **Streamlit**: For creating the user interface and real-time video streaming.
